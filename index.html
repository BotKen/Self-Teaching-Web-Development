<h1>TIM'S HTML</h1>

    <p>
       In the beginning, <br/>
       Tim created the HyperText Markup Language. <br/>
       The Internet was without form and void, <br/>
       and text was upon the face of the monitor and <br/>
       the Hands of Tim were moving  <br/>
        over the face of the keyboard. <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
       And Tim said,<br/>
      " Let there be links" ; <br/>
       And there were links. <br/> 
       And Tim saw that the links were good; <br/>
       And Tim separated the links from the text. <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim called the links Anchors,<br/>
      And the text He called Other Stuff. <br/>
      And the whole thing together <br/>
      Was the first Web Page.<br/>
