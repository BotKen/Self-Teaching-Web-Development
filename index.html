    <h1>TIM'S HTML</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
       In the beginning, <br>
       Tim created the HyperText Markup Language. <br>
       The Internet was without form and void, <br>
       and text was upon the face of the monitor and <br>
       the Hands of Tim were moving  <br>
        over the face of the keyboard. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
       And Tim said,<br>
      " Let there be links" ; <br>
       And there were links. <br> 
       And Tim saw that the links were good; <br>
       And Tim separated the links from the text. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim called the links Anchors,<br>
      And the text He called Other Stuff. <br>
      And the whole thing together <br>
      Was the first Web Page.<br>

 Cross the rivers, climb the peaks.
      But first check for texts.
